PART-1:-

1. what is npm 
npm is package manager it manages all the packages
2. initialize npm using npm init
3. there will create a package.json file , it contains all the inforamtion which u added while initializing npm init
4. we need a bundler to bundle all our project into single file
5. Bundler is nothing but it will bundle all the files like js, css, html files into single file
6. for this we have 3 bundlers webpackk , parcel e.t.c, i preferred parcel for this project
7. install parcel using npm i -D install
8. what is -D , there is two dependencies , dependencies, devDependenicie
9. now parcel has installed and package-lock.json created and in the package.json devDependencies added
10. in the package.josn devDependencies the parcel will reflect with version name, there is a caret symbol 
11. ^caret symbol indicates that if there is any upgrade in the parcel version it will update automatcally and tilde~ also for mjor changes
12. now check the node modules we have lot of folders because of if u install any package it will install there dependcies and if that has also dependecies that wil also be installed
13. so the node_modules contains all of the packages code , thats why we normally see that many folders and the weightage of that folder is also very high
14. if u want to push the total node_modules into git that will be the blunder mistake of urs so for that git has one option
15. that is .gitignore file, in the file what are files and folders u want to ignore mention in the gitignore file,  when u r pushing the code into git , that files will be ingored
16. and that files we can delete too, we can install again by using command npm install
17.
